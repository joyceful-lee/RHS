        <h1>The world is scary nowadays.</h1>
        <p>
          Lately, I have found myself overwhelmed by the relentless stream of bad news, leaving me searching for
          ways to take action without simply donating to my representatives (what they do with the donations, I dunno).
          However, I realized that while I feel the desperation to act, I lack the necessary knowledge and organization
          to take an informed stand.
        </p>
        <p>
          To do my part in combating my own lack of knowledge, I started on this page to dive deep into the plans for
          the next few years and to see what is most likely coming in the next few months. I may not be eloquent or the
          most organized, but I can put in work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless of political affiliation, <mark>I hope this platform serves as a resource for learning, grounded in
            fact-checked information</mark> (shoot me an email if anything you see is incorrect), even if it carries
          inherent
          bias.
        </p>
        <p>
          To be transparent, I have strong personal objections to Donald Trump’s leadership and an even deeper disdain
          for Elon Musk. However, if I am proven wrong and Trump’s presidency champions equality, personal freedoms,
          and global/community safety, I am willing to acknowledge that and accept any criticism. Unfortunately, given
          the administration's early actions, including deportations and restrictions on transgender service members in
          the military, the outlook is already grim.
        </p>
        <h2>Headlines are often the only parts that get read.</h2>
        <p>
          For those who identify as Christian, <mark>I urge you to reflect deeply.</mark> This administration’s actions
          stand in
          stark contrast to the teachings of Christ. Elevating political figures as idols not only distorts the core
          principles of faith, but also contradicts the very lessons imparted by the Bible.
        </p>
        <p>
          For those who are proud that they respect authority and are loyal to their cause, it would be admirable if the
          one you were following wasn't leading you down the path of extremism. In my experience as a leader, the
          ultimate show of respect was when people could tell me when I could do better. Instead of ruling with an iron
          fist, the administration should guide us towards a better future for those who agree AND disgree, not just for
          some. <mark>In the United States, the people should come first.</mark> Not just the top 1%, but everyone. You
          are supposed to have a voice and your representatives should serve you not the other way around (I say this
          for representatives of both parties cause everyone has been pissing me off).
